# budgetApp
A simple app that lets u keep track of ur budget with features of updating a budget, displaying your expenditure , spent and left amount.
technologies and frameworks used - HTML, CSS, VanillaJs DOM, Bootstrap(only for nav-bars and forms), to add responsiveness I have used media queries, all the icons are from font awesome, and font styles are used from google fonts.
